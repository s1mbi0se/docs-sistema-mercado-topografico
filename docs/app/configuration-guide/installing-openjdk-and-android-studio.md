### Configure **the ANDROID\_HOME environment variable**

The React Native tools require some environment variables to be set up in order to build apps with native code.

Add the following lines to your `$HOME/.bash_profile` or `$HOME/.bashrc`&#x20;

if you are using `zsh` then `~/.zprofile` or `~/.zshrc`) config file:

export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
