# ðŸ“² Expo: emulate your app

### Step 1: Create account on Expo

Access the Expo website and create an account on the platform. It is recommended that you create an account by entering your email and password and not by SSO login, this will make it easier when you login through the terminal with the command _**eas login**_.

### Step 2: Request access to organization

In order for you to be able to build and make the app available to be viewed on your cell phone, you need to request access to the organization. Ask one of the admins to add you.
